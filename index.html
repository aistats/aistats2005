<p>Barbados is a tropical island in the south east of the Caribbean.
According to the Lonely Planet Guide: "The western coast has
white-sand beaches
and calm turquoise waters, while the cliff-lined Atlantic eastern coast is much
more turbulent. Coral reefs surround most of the island. Barbados boasts 3000 hours of sunshine every year. In January the average daily high temperature is 28C (83F)."</p>
