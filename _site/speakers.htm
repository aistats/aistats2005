decisions on behalf of users whose utility function is not known with
certainty. Although one can engage in elicitation until a utility
function is perfectly known, in practice, this is infeasible. Thus
methods for decision making with imprecise utility functions are needed.
We propose the use of minimax regret as an appropriate decision
criterion in this circumstance, providing the means for determining
robust decisions.  We overview recent techniques we have developed for
minimax regret computation in several different settings, with a focus
of methods that exploit graphical utility models.  We also describe how
minimax regret can be used to drive the process of eliciting preferences
itself.

  knowledge representation, belief revision, default reasoning, and
  philosophical logic, to probabilistic reasoning, decision making under
  uncertainty, multiagent systems, and machine learning. His current
  research efforts focus on various aspects of decision making under
  uncertainty: Markov decision processes, game theory and multiagent
  decision processes, economic models, reinforcement learning,
  probabilistic inference and preference elicitation.

	  <p><strong>&quot;Probabilistic Models for Identifying Regulation Networks:
	      From
Qualitative to Quantitative Models&quot;</strong></p>
	  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
	    Microarray-based hybridization methods techniques allow to
simultaneously measure the expression level for thousands of genes.
Such measurements contain information about many different aspects of
gene regulation and function, and indeed this type of experiments has
become a central tool in biological research. A major computational
challenge is extracting new biological understanding from this wealth
of data.</p>

<p>Our goal is to understand the regulatory processes that bring about
the observed expression patterns. This involves uncovering the
structure of the interactions between genes, the function of different
regulators, the mechanisms by which it influences its targets, and the
dynamics of the process. Answers to these questions can come at
different levels of details, depending on the available data, the
modeling assumptions, and prior knowledge.  In my talk, I will
describe an ongoing project to use probabilistic graphical models,
such as Bayesian networks and their extensions of them to model and
reverse engineer regulatory networks from expression data.</p>

<p>I will explain the basic foundations of the approach, the model
choices in defining the modeling language and in learning models from
data, and methods to visualize and interpret the learned models to
extract additional biological insight.  I will present a progression
of models that capture different aspect of gene regulation, and an
assessment of their performance on several large scale yeast gene
expression experiments.</p>

	  <p><strong>&quot;Identification and Separation of DNA Mixtures using Peak Area Information&quot;</strong></p>
	  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
	   The lecture will describe and discuss how probabilistic expert systems can
be used
to analyse forensic identification problems involving DNA
mixture traces using quantitative peak area information.
Peak area is modelled with conditional Gaussian distributions or with models
based on the gamma distribution. Such systems can be used for ascertaining
whether individuals,
whose profiles have been measured, have contributed to the mixture, but also
to predict
DNA profiles of unknown contributors by separating the mixture
into its individual components. The potential of this
methodology is illustrated on case data examples and compared
with alternative approaches. The advantages are
that identification and separation issues can be handled in a unified way
within a single network model and the uncertainty associated with the
analysis is quantified. The lecture is almost entirely based upon joint work
with Robert Cowell and Julia Mortera.

	  <p><strong>&quot;Some intuitions about message
        passing&quot;</strong></p>
	  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
	    I will give an intuitive perspective of message passing algorithms,<br>
	    including loopy belief propagation, generalized belief propagation,<br>
	    variational message passing, and expectation propagation. I will show<br>
	    how to view them in a unified way, give a feel for where they work,<br>
	    and when you should use one method over another. I will also discuss<br>
	    when message passing is a good way to do inference at all, and what<br>
	    are the main problems with it.<br>
