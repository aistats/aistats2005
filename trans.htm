      <p><strong><font color="#006633">Note:</font></strong> If you are travelling
        to Barbados from Europe and are having a difficult time finding flights,
        we have found direct flights from the following cities:  London, New
        York, Miami, Toronto, and Philadelphia. We have noticed that flying
        from certain cities in Europe, even when online booking sites claim there
        are no available flights, can be done by separately combining flights
        to one of these cities, and then from that city to Barbados. This may
        be a much less expensive option even if online sites do show possible
        flights. Alternatively, talking to a human travel agent might help.</p>
      <p>The only Barbados airport is the Grantley Adams International Airport.
        The airport is 8 miles from The Savannah and the trip takes about 20
        minutes by car. Taxis can be taken from outside the arrivals hall for
        a fare of approximately $15 (all prices given here are in US$). Taxis
        can also be found at or near the hotels, and taxi fare between hotels
        is
        about $7.
        A free shuttle bus service between the Blue Horizon and Savannah hotels
        will be provided twice daily, for each of the morning and evening sessions.</p>
      <p>Cars may also be rented at the airport, or, likely less expensively, at
	  the hotels. The cost of renting a Nissan Almera from the airport is $267.74 for 3 days and
	  $441.00 for 5-7 days. Driving is on the UK side of the road.</p>
	  <p>US dollars can be spent in Barbados, and the conversion rate is fixed at
  approximately $2 Barbadian for every $1 US.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p></td>
