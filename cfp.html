<H3>CALL FOR PAPERS - AISTATS 2005</H3>
<h2><font color="#FF0000">Extended Deadline for Paper Submissions: September 28, 2004</font>&nbsp;</H2>

<p>This
  is the tenth workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,
  an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of
  computer science, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception
  in 1985, the primary goal of this workshop has been to broaden
  research in both of these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas
  between them. We encourage the submission of all papers which are in
  keeping with this objective.</p>
<p>Presentations will include invited talks, contributed talks, and
  posters. Papers for poster sessions will be treated equally 
  with papers for oral presentation in publications. </p>
<p>Papers on all aspects of the interface between AI &amp; Statistics are
  strongly encouraged, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Active learning and experimental design <br>
  Approximate Inference<br>
  Automated data analysis <br>
  Bayesian networks<br>
  Bayesian statistics<br>
